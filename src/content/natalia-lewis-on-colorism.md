As a designer, I cannot pretend as if I have not seen similar behaviors and treatment that  Natalia Lewis
described. I choose my models based on the energy they have to offer the audience and the designs. However, during a casting, I had another designer speak with me after because their team wanted to work with a model I had selected. They said to me, “there are a lot of pretty white girls for you to choose from.” They wanted to use the model to claim their stance on diversity. Diversity is not just checking a box. All women deserve equal representation, but not to elevate a close-minded brand trying to check boxes. I have an obligation to my models and the industry not to turn a blind eye.
