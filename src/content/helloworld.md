Women are thoughtful, patient, and they understand that timing is everything. This is because, without caution, every thought, opinion, and emotion are assumed to be dramatic --one of the many things that “come along” with the gender.

We make our moves carefully because dramatic businesswomen do not exist. Assumptions of our gender tell women that their ambitions, their good ideas are not as relevant as society’s misconceptions.

I have been lucky enough to watch hundreds of intelligent, strong women work to create a space for themselves in the industry; regardless of stereotypes.

Countless times I have witnessed women build each other up, teach each other, and encourage one another.

I am so proud to be a woman in the fashion industry where I can continuously be inspired by the women I meet. Thank you to women --creating space for ourselves and others alike.
